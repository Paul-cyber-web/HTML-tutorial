      <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p>
        Metallica is an American heavy metal band. The band was formed in 1981
        in Los Angeles by vocalist and guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars
        Ulrich, and has been based in San Francisco for most of its
        career.[1][2] The band's fast tempos, instrumentals, and aggressive
        musicianship made them one of the founding "big four" bands of thrash
        metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax, and Slayer.
